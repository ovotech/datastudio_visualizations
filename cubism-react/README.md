# Cubism, React!
Welcome to Cubism, this time React-ified.

## What is a Cubism?
Cubism graphs are high-density charts that are super useful for dashboarding whilst keeping a higher resolution.
See [Square's Cubism.js documentation](https://square.github.io/cubism/) for more information on the charts and how they're better than line charts for high-density dashboarding.

## How do I use this?
There's an example inside the demos folder, we will be adding to the demos as we progress with the project.

## I found a bug!
Great! Create an issue, and if you can: submit a PR!
